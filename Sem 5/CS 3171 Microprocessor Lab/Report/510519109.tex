\section[Find out the sum of the first 30 natural numbers]{Assignment 1} %[toc content]{text content}
    \subsection{Objective}
        Find out the sum of the first 30 natural numbers.
    \subsection{Tool/Experimental setup considered}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Jubin's 8085 Simulator
        \end{itemize}
    \subsection{Procedure}
        We know that
        \[1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 29 + 30 = \frac{30 \times 29}{2} = 435 =  01D1H\]
        This result is not possible to store in a single register, so we need to use register pair to store the result.
    \subsection{Program}
        \lstinputlisting[caption=assembly program to find sum of the first 30 natural numbers]{./../Programs/Assignment 1/1_1_sum till 30.asm}

            \label{fg1}
        \end{figure}
    \subsection{Conclusion}
        We see that after the execution of program, the data stored in HL register pair is 01D1H, which is the hexadecimal value of 435.\\
        Hence the program is working as expected.

        From an array of 10-byte size integers (unsigned) find out the maximum and minimum.
    \subsection{Tool/Experimental setup considered}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Jubin's 8085 Simulator
        \end{itemize}
    \subsection{Procedure}
        The idea is to linearly iterate through all the values of the arr, and update the register for minimum(C) and maximum(B) values.
    \subsection{Program}

            \caption{Result for different inputs}
            \label{fg2}

    \subsection{Conclusion}
        We see that that after program execution, B has the maximum value of array, and C has the minimum value of the array.\\
        Hence the program is working as expected.

\section[Delay Procedure]{Assignment 3} %[toc content]{text content}
    \subsection{Objective}
        Write a routine that produces a delay. The delay value must be passed to register pair DE.
    \subsection{Tool/Experimental setup considered}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Jubin's 8085 Simulator
        \end{itemize}
    \subsection{Procedure}
        Idea is to assign DE a very big value (say FFFF), and decrement it in a loop till DE becomes 0 to produce delay in execution.
    \subsection{Program}
        \lstinputlisting[caption=assembly program to produce delay]{./../Programs/Assignment 1/1_3_delay.asm}
    \subsection{Conclusion}
        We see that the code runs for sometime, then completes it's execution, signifying that the delay function worked and delayed execution of CPU for some time.\\
        Hence the program is working as expected.

\section[Check if number odd]{Assignment 5} %[toc content]{text content}
    \subsection{Objective}
        Write a function isODD(unsigned n) in assembly that takes an unsigned integer (a byte) and determines if it is odd (returns 1) or 0 if it is even.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Jubin's 8085 Simulator
        \end{itemize}
    \subsection{Procedure}
        Odd numbers will always be in the form of $2x + 1$, which means that they will have 1 as their LSB.\\
        So we just check if $number \land 01$ is 1 or not. If the result is 1, then the number is odd, else it is even.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Jubin's 8085 Simulator

    \subsection{Procedure}
        We use the Shift-and-Add Multiplication to fast multiply 15 and 9, as register size is 8 bits, we can do this multiplication by using a loop which runs 8 times, i.e O(1)\\
        This method is faster than default loop method, which run in O(min(m, n)), where m and n are the numbers that will be multiplied.

        In your case the function takes the start address of the RAM block and the block size in bytes.
        The function sets CY in case of any error (else it is set to 0); HL contains the faulty location and Acc contains 0 for stuck at zero fault and 1 for stuck at one fault.
        [Note: usually there wont be any error as your RAM is not faulty, so direct checking may not set CY flag]

    \subsection{Conclusion}
        We see that when X is in array, Cy flag is set and HL points to the data's address in array; but then X is not present, Cy flag is not set.\\
        Hence the program is working as expected.

\section[Time Period of a rectangular waveform signal]{Assignment 12} %[toc content]{text content}
    \subsection{Objective}
    Suppose that you are reading a bit of an input port (say, PORT 0) to which the output of a function generator, producing a rectangular wave, is connected. Measure the ON  of this repetitive rectangular waveform time in terms of millisecond.
    \subsection{Procedure}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item We first wait in an infinite loop, waiting for the signal to turn 0 (in case we started program when signal was already 1).
            \item Then when the signal turns 0, the actual count procedure starts, we again keep waiting in an infinite loop, waiting for the signal to go 1 again.
            \item When the signal goes 1 now, we start counting the amount of time the signal is 1 in another infinite loop.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item The two register pair is too small to count the number of machine cycles it took for the signal to go to 0.
                    \item so we added a delay (1 ms) after every count, now the count signifies the amount of (1ms) delays it took for signal to go to 0.
                \end{itemize}
            \item now the signal is back to 0, and we have the amount of delays it took for signal to go to 0, we write that data to SAVELOC.
        \end{enumerate}
    \subsection{Program}
        \lstinputlisting[caption=assembly program to calculate time period of rectangular wave]{./../Programs/Assignment 4/4_3_Port.asm}
    \subsection{Conclusion}
        We created a program which will calculate the time period of a rectangular wave as follows
        \[T= BC*(30*1/3 + 1ms) = BC*11ms \pm 2 ms\]

\section[Interrupt Service Routine]{Assignment 13} %[toc content]{text content}
    \subsection{Objective}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Using auto vectored input RST 7.5 prepare a scheme to count the number of key-press done at this interrupting input.
            \item The main routine after initialization of the interrupt mechanism waits in an infinite loop waiting for the key-press. 
            \item On a key-press (that simulates as if you have excited the RST 7.5 input) it increases a counter at a predefined memory location (used to hold the count value).
        \end{itemize}
    \subsection{Tool/Experimental setup considered}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Jubin's 8085 Simulator
        \end{itemize}
    \subsection{Procedure}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item We use an RST 7.5 interrupt line to call a procedure every time we get an interrupt.
            \item The Problem is that the computer is so fast that it can take in multiple interrupt in a single button press(click).
            \item To solve this, we disable the interrupt mechanism inside the Interrupt Service Routine, and also add a small delay to make the computer "wait" for the key-press to end.
        \end{enumerate}
    \subsection{Program}

            \label{fg11}

    \subsection{Conclusion}
        We see that the value in DE register pair after program stop matches with the number of clicks made for interrupts.\\
        Hence the program is working as expected.

\section[Hardware Debouncing]{Assignment 14} %[toc content]{text content}
    \subsection{Objective}
        Draw the hardware for implementing RST 7.5 based key-press counting -- don't forget to implement h/w based key debouncing problem.
    \subsection{Procedure}
        We previously used software method (using delay) to mitigate debouncing, now we will look into the method to reducing debouncing hardware wise.\par
        One of the simplest hardware-based switch debounce solutions employs a resistor-capacitor (RC) network in conjunction with a switch (i.e our key).

        \begin{figure}[h!]
            \centering
            \fbox{\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Assignment 5/2_hardware debouncing/default circuit.png}}
            \caption{Hardware based Switch Debouncing}
            \label{fg12}
        \end{figure}

        When the key is not pressed, there is a way for the power to go from +ve to ground via R1, D1 and C1, which keeps $V_c$ as high, and $V_{sh}$ as low as shown in \ref{fg13a}.\par
        When the key is pressed, the circuit is shorted due to the new circuit and $V_c$ becomes low, making $V_{sh}$ as high as shown in \ref{fg13b}\par
        The capacitor is used to remove the false signals due to debouncing and providing a smoother gradient towards On and Off as shown in \ref{fg14}

    \subsection{Conclusion}
        We discussed hardware based debouncing mechanism to reduce errors while taking input.
