g++ -c circular_linked_list_game.cpp

    -c  stop the compiling process after the assembling stage, translating our files from .c to .o

    will generate circular_linked_list_game.o


Now Deleted circular_linked_list_game.cpp for code protection [backup in ".hidden" folder]    

g++ main.cpp *.o

    * is wildcard

    will generate a.out

./a.out

one liner after compilation of .o files: 
g++ main.cpp *.o && ./a.out
