gcc -c recursion.c 

    -c  stop the compiling process after the assembling stage, translating our files from .c to .o


ar -rc  librecursion.a recursion.o

    the -rc options create the archive without a warning and replaces any pre-existing object files in the library with the same name.
    

Now Deleted recursion.c for code protection [backup in Problem 2 folder]    

gcc main.c -L . -l recursion 

    -L says “look in directory for library files”
    . (the dot after ‘L’) represents the current working directory
    -l says “link with this library file”
    forme is the name of our library. Note that we omitted the “lib” prefix and “.a” extension. The linker attaches these parts back to the name of the library to create a name of a file to look for.
    -o my_program says “name the executable file output.out”

    It will give a lot of warnings, ignore all the "function not found" warnings,gcc can't find function as they are archived in librecursion.a

./a.out
