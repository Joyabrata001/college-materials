exporting data structure into file
are you exporting field wise or complete node? Can you export complete node at once ?

deleting a node in linked list [in paper]
exporting to a file [structure]

Write function to Delete middle element of LL
Write function to store BST elements in array such that lchild=2i, rchild =2i+1
Why we use void pointer in generic? 
In generic LL and BST, what will happen if we don't use memcpy function?

[File Handling Extension to GLL]
why we need "void setCompareFn(genericLL g, int (*compFn)(void *, void*))"

[Sparse Matrix GLL] [void addNodeGLL(genericLL g, void *d)]
why we need g->dsize
if used gave data on his own, do we need g->dsize?
{ if void * d is a pointer to already defined data by user, then do we need dsize?}
what would be the cost of not using g->dsize then?
convince me that you have done coding questions on your own
how was mid sem?

Linked List Sorting

Print the nodes which are having even integer

Structure of generic queue
Insertion function of gen queue
Function to find the height of a binary tree
How was the class

what dies the name of the array indicated by
what is #include
difference between #include<stdio.h> and #include "stdio.h" : <> is for system header, "" for custom header
what is better s[i]>='a' or s[i]>=97    :first one is comparing 16 bit(small) comparison, but the later is 32 bit(big) comparison, so first one is faster

merge two sortedLL to a third sortedLL
