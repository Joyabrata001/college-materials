What are Linear Systems : Systems which follow additivity and Homogeneity
Give an Example of Linear Systems
Is differentiation Linear
Are the simulation we did linear?

What is impulse?
Time Duration Of Impulse
Height of impulse
agar gamma hui toh height?  : 1/gamma

what is Fourier Series  : Way of representing a signal as sum of sine and cosine function
Why we use Fourier Series
Examples of fourier series
Why we need Fourier Series
Components of Fourier Series

Explain Linearity Of System with details on additivity
Explain time Invariance of a System

What is transfer function: H(jw), or H(s) or H(s), Y/X, Y->Output, X->Input
what is the effect of laplace transformations on integrations and differentiation
what is second order System
give Example    : RLC, spring mass with dampening

difference between continuos and Discrete signal
numerical question based on this

suppose I am standing in a bus stop, and I saw the bus and started running towards it, is this second order system? :no?

what will be the answer if we put w = 2pi in e^jw

why do we use convolution
why do we don't have to do convolution in transform domain

we write x(jw) in continuos domain, what do we write in discrete domain?    : X(e^jw)
why we do this?

Why do we fourier transform?
How to suppress harmonics?

Stability of system
Tell stability of system across two poles in z transformation

What is impulse function and step function?

What happens if Fourier Series doesn't Exist    : We will not be able to transform to frequency domain, so we will not be able to able to make frequency based system (like filters)

find sampling of a function
sampling time of a function
nyquist sampling theory

what is modulation?
Why do we need Modulation?
Why don't we prefer Amplitude Modulation?

Explain Signal in terms of Power Supply
Relation of frequency and Power Supply of a signal
