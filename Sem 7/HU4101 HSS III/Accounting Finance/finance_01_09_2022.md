# How to compute cost?

-   we have different types of costing which is based on variety of factors

    -   there is distinguishable characteristics of different category of industry
    -   types of industry

        -   small, medium, large scale (not of our use cause they are not used for cost computation)
        -   Goods Manufacturing / Service Sector

            -   difference is in cost unit; unit by which you can use to express cost
            -   Goods Manufacturing -> no. of good that is being sold

                -   Eg: 4 washing machine at 20k
                -   cost units are readily available from market
                -   Two Types for manufacturing

                    -   we manufacture standardized

                        -   each product has same cost
                        -   cost = sum of cost / number of units
                        -   unitary method or averaging of cost
                        -   Eg: 1 million unit at x price, cost = x/1million
                        -   advantage: easy to compute cost, juts a simple averaging
                        -   two ways
                            -   only one stage of operation
                                -   Unit and Output Costing
                            -   multiple stages of operation, where we can also sell intermediate market
                                -   we can sell the intermediate product or we can process it more to increase the product's value
                                -   Eg: thread -> yarn -> fabric -> printed fabric
                                -   we use process costing to determine costing

                    -   we do custom jobs as per the specification of customer
                        -   product will have different cost
                        -   can't do averaging as customer specification makes the products entirely different from each other
                        -   we can convert the custom products into something which can be equally measured
                            -   Eg: assume we making cages for 3 buffalo and 2 donkeys, we convert them into 5 animals (size of the bigger animal) and make 5 cages for that bigger animal (conversion)
                        -   one method is to track cost for every individual product being made
                        -   two case
                            -   simple case
                                -   JOb Costing (cost per individual order)
                            -   construction
                                -   Eg: we make a dam which also takes a lot of time
                                -   two way:
                                    -   we get money at end of construction, govt take 50% money
                                    -   we get emi based money at regular interval
                                        -   this will need track of % task done and will also require some third party people
                                        -   constructor might also run away making more cost, so we need protection against those as well
                                -   cost method use: contract costing

            -   Service
                -   Eg: goods transport service
                    -   cost unit: can be distance(km), can be weight, no specific predefined method
                -   method: operating cost unit
                    -   ability to deal with cost in service sector
                    -   we use a composite unit
                        -   Eg: cost per km per weight
