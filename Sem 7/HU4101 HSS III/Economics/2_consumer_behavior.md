# Consumer Behavior

-   Utility: Usefulness or enjoyment a consumer gets from a good/service

    -   Two Types
        1.  Total Utility : The total benefits of use of services/goods
        2.  Marginal Utility: If a consumer is availing extra goods then the extra satisfaction he/she is availing is called Marginal Utility

-   Two Laws
    1.  Law of Equi-Marginal Utility
    2.  Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility

## Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility

-   The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility says that the Marginal Utility from each additional unit declines as the consumption increases.

    -   Marginal utility is the incremental increase in utility that results from the consumption of one additional unit.

-   Example

| Units (x) | Total Utility (TU) | Marginal Utility ($TU_x - TU_{(x-1)}$) |
| --------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| 1         | 30                 | 30                                     |
| 2         | 45                 | 15                                     |
| 3         | 50                 | 5                                      |
| 4         | 50                 | 0                                      |
| 5         | 45                 | -5                                     |
| 6         | 30                 | -15                                    |

-   TU increases then reaches some top, then decreases. Similarly MU keeps on decreasing as we consume more units of some product.

    -   Eg: One IceCream is fun, two is also fun, but eating 10 IceCream is not Fun

## Law of Equi-Marginal Utility

This law will work ONLY under Assumptions:

1. Consumer is Rational
    - Rational: Consumer will act in his best interest
2. Utility is Cardinal

    - Utility can be measured in some units (like money)

3. Marginal Utility of Money is constant
    - Value of money is constant for everyone
4. Marginal Utility of goods is diminishing
5. Utility is Additive
    - cause we measure in same unit (which is money)

According to Law, If

$MU_x/ P_x = MU_y/ P_y = ... = MU_n/ P_n$ or

$MU_x/MU_y = P_x/Py$

then consumer will have highest satisfaction and prices will be in equilibrium

where $P_n$ is the price of n

Example:
| Units(x) | Marginal Utility of product x [Rs 2/x]|Marginal Utility of product y [Rs 3/y]|
| -------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| 1 | 20 | 24 |
| 2 | 18 | 21 |
| 3 | 16 | 18 |
| 4 | 14 | 15 |
| 5 | 12 | 9 |
| 6 | 10 | 3 |

or

| Units(x) | Marginal Utility (of product x) [Rs 2/x] | $MU_x/P_x$ | Marginal Utility (of product y) [Rs 3/x] | $MU_y/P_y$ |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| 1        | 20                                       | 10         | 24                                       | 8          |
| 2        | 18                                       | 9          | 21                                       | 7          |
| 3        | 16                                       | 8          | 18                                       | 6          |
| 4        | 14                                       | 7          | 15                                       | 5          |
| 5        | 12                                       | 6          | 9                                        | 3          |
| 6        | 10                                       | 5          | 3                                        | 1          |

consider case $MU_x/P_x = MU_y/P_y = 8$

-   3x2 + 1x3 = 9 [buy 3 units of x and 1 unit of y]

and in case $MU_x/P_x = MU_y/P_y = 7$

-   4x2 + 2x3 = 14 [buy 4 units of x and 2 unit of y]

and in consider case $MU_x/P_x = MU_y/P_y = 6$

-   5x2 + 3x3 = 19 [buy 5 unit of x and 3 unit of y]

-   Observation: when ratio is big, total price used in lowest, hence more satisfaction [follow sth law of diminishing utility

## Analysis

1. Cardinal Utility Analysis

2. Ordinal Utility Analysis

# Ordinal Utility

-   Utility is measured in terms of "order" or "preferences"
-   Assumptions
    1.  Rationality (discussed in last class)
    2.  Diminishing Marginal Rate of Substitution
    3.  Utility is Ordinal
    4.  Consistency and Transitivity of Choices
        -   Consistency: If A > B at a certain period of Time, then at that time B > A is not possible
            -   Eg: consider person prefers A over B, then he can't prefer B over A at the same time
        -   Transitivity : If A>B and B>C then A>C
    5.  Quantity is Additive

We need **Indifference Curve** and **Budget Line** to achieve consumer Equilibrium

Indifference Curve: locus of combination of different units of goods which give same utility
