# Economics

-   Good things are Scarce and Humans are greedy
-   Economics teaches cost effective ways and sustainable way of allocation of resources, etc.

-   Economics have two types
    1.  Micro Economics: Study of individual, households and firm's behavior in decision making and allocation of resources
    2.  Macro Economics: studies how an overall economy behaves
        -   contains stuff like inflation, price level, national Income, etc

# Introduction to Micro Economics

## Supply Demand Equilibrium

-   State in which Market Supply and Consumer Demand are in equilibrium, which determines the price of goods
-   If this equilibrium is broken, the prices will get altered

    -   If Supply increases (Demand const), price go down
    -   If Demand increases (Supply same), price will go up

## Economic Model

-   An Economic Model is a simplified version of real life, which is used to make hypothesis about economic behavior (and tested in the same model also)

## Cause Effect Relationship

-   A Cause Effect Relationship occurs when an event causes another.

-   Q) determine if this statement is valid: "If Government puts price control on food during a famine, it will cause hunger despite govt. best interest"

    -   A) consider the case where there is no price control, people who can buy food in excess will hoard them (depleting inventory of food for general people) and then sell it in black market with higher selling price

    -   consider the case when govt tries to avoid black market situation by controlling prices, in this case people may buy in bulk and will wait for food's increase in price to sell them again for profits
    -   even while govt tried to reduce hunger, it actually did not happen, hence the statement is true
    -   actual good solution: Quantity Control (x food item per person)

-   Q) In the answer to the previous question, find the cause and the effects
